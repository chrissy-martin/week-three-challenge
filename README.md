# Password Generator 


## Description

This is the week 3 challenge in the UW Bootcamp: Password Generator. The goal for this project is to create an application that will generate a random password based on the criteria the user has selected. Some criteria options include: having between 8-128 characters, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters, etc. CSS and HTML code was included in the project and there was starter code for the JavaScript file. I added to the JavaScript file to finish the project. 

## Usage

To use this application, simlpy click on the "Generate Password" button and follow the prompts given at the top of the screen. See the following screenshots for a quick walk-through.

The deployed application can be found here: https://chrissy-martin.github.io/week-three-challenge/

These first two screenshots are the code that I added to the starter code for the project.
