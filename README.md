# Password Generator 


## Description

This is the week 3 challenge in the UW Bootcamp: Password Generator. The goal for this project is to create an application that will generate a random password based on the criteria the user has selected. Some criteria options include: having between 8-128 characters, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters, etc. CSS and HTML code was included in the project and there was starter code for the JavaScript file. I added to the JavaScript file to finish the project. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
